# Welcome new and old user of ecoCreature!
# ----------------------------------------
# It is vital that you go through the configuration from start to end before you continue
# using this plugin, to make sure that it is functioning with your server configuration.
#
# Remember, it is YOUR server, it is YOUR rules. You can not appease everyone.
#
# Now then ...
#
# Which economy system are you running? ecoCreature supports the following four.
# iConomy, BOSEconomy, Essentials, MineConomy
#
# As an example, you have BOSE, you should change the CORE setting to Core: BOSEconomy
#
# IntegerCurrency set to true will round the reward to a whole number, no decimals.
# While if it is set to false, it will give rewards with a decimal value.
#
# AllowCamping defaults to false, it will prevent camping around mobspawners / dungeons etc.
# This setting is followed by CampRadius - what it does is that it prevents camping within the set
# amount of blocks in all directions. Both can be changed to suit your needs.
#
# ClearCampDrops is available as an option, it will clear the creature / monster drops if set to
# true, and if false, it will allow regular creature drops.
#
# OverrideDrops, if set to true... default drops will be overriden by the drops specified
# for ecoCreature. This only applies to the player killed monsters.
# If a monster dies by accident / fire / whatever it will default to the Minecraft default drops. Have
# this in mind.
#
# FixedDrops
# If you do not like your drops to be random between 0 and the amount you wanted, set FixedDrops to true
# and the creature / spawner will drop the amount of items you specified.
#
# BowRewards
# If this value is set to false, there will be no gains from killing with a bow.
#
# PenalizeDeath should only be set to true if you want to penalize your players for dieing while hunting.
# as it will withdraw the money they hold in their hand, and not from their banks, if they have that.
#
# PenalizeType, this has two values: true or false.
# If the type is set to false, the amount will be a flat amount, a constant value of the set amount upon death.
# If the type is set to true, the amount will be used as a percentage value and drawn from the total held currency.
# This is so that ecoCreature knows whether you want to punish via flatrate or percent.
#
# PenalizeAmount - How much money should they drop, from the amount they already have?
# This depends on what you set the type to, flat or percent (false or true).
# An example;
# PenalizeType: true <---- we want to punish with percentage of held money
# PenalizeAmount: 5 <---- draw 5% of the players held money
#
# AllowUnderSeaLVL - Really not that useful, should in most cases be set to true.
# What does it do? If you are under the sea level when hunting, rewards are enabled. If this is set to false,
# you will not get rewards for kills below sea level. This applies to everything under sea level.
#
# Message Options!
# ----------------
# Output :: Should you notify the player of rewards, penalties or no rewards? Defaults to true - to notify.
# NoReward :: If set to true, it will output a message to the player, stating he got no reward, false will not
# output anything to the player when they get no reward.
# Spawner :: When accidently killing around the spawn, a player can be notified of a nearby dungeon.
# Having this option set to false will not send them the spawn/mobspawn camping message.
#
# Gains!
# -----
# These are per group on your server, if a player is in a group called Donors in your permissions
# they will gain the base amount * value specified in the amount bit for the group.
# You may freely add additional groupnames and specify your own amount here.
# The group names must match those within your Permissions configuration, ecoCreature compares.

# HOW DO I DROPS!?
#     - format: 'item:amount:percent'
#     - more drops: Seperate the items with ; add next
#         - format example: 'item:amount:percent;item2:amount:percent'
# This means, first you input the item id, second the item max amount upon drop, and third
# is the chanse it has to drop, in percent... 50 yields a fifty fifty, for instance.
#
# -+-+- Special note on the AMOUNT, if you set an item to drop with the value set to 10
#       it selects a random amount, there's no guarantee that it will be fixed to 10.
#       ---> This will later be optional.
#
# Coin_Minimum - Minium amount of coins to drop.
# Coin_Maximum - The max amount of coins to drop.
# !!! With a low minimum and high maximum, you will get a random amount between those values
#
# OH GOD, FIXED AMOUNT ... ALL THE WAY!
# Sometimes, it would be great if the amount was fixed instead of everchanging, but how?
# It's simple... set the MINIMUM to the same amount as MAXIMUM - and you're ready for action!
#
# Coin_Percent - What are the odds to receive any currency at all?
#
# NoReward_Message - Even if the player doesn't receive a reward, a death message can be configured.
#
# Reward_Message - Every creature destroyed can have its personal reward message upon death
#     - Acceptable codes:
#     - &colourcode - Check out the forum post for the colour codes!
#     - <crt> - Will display creature name
#     - <amt> - Will display the amount + currency
#     - <itm> - Will display the item you held in your hand at the time
#
# Penalty_Message - If you have a negative amount for a creature, this is the custom message
# for when the player is penalized with a deduction.

            Configure: false

# If you have now reached this point of the ecoCreature.yml file, you may of have noticed the last entry.
# Switch the Configure: false to Configure: true
#
# Why? It means that you have, hopefully, read, understood as well as configured the plugin to your needs.
# If this value is still false when you start your server, the plugin will be disabled.
#
# WHY!?
# Because. It simply just explains itself. Don't even think about starting an argument about it.
